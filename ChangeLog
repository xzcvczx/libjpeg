	* commit new source from Guido Vollbeding:
	He has done some further "facelifting" in
	jpegclub.org/libjpeg-6c.tar.gz:
	
	Merged jdhuff.h and jdphuff.c into jdhuff.c,
	merged jchuff.h and jcphuff.c into jchuff.c.
	Updated makefile.cfg accordingly.
	This cleans up the Huffman coding modules.

	Updated the DCT scaling support so that compression behaves
	like decompression side:  Wenn chosing floating point DCT,
	adapt scaled DCT method accordingly instead of failure.
	Makes compression and decompression exactly symmetric in
	this regard.
	Changed the DCT manager and coefficient controller modules
	for this, also required changes in the global jpegint.h
	(forward DCT manager struct).
